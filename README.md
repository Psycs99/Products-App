# Products-App
This is a simple application of what a product sales site would look like.

ATTENTION: you must add or modify the code in (products_app\lib\services\auth_services) and add your own Fire Base Token for it to work, 
you may also have to modify the URL, just maybe.

In this application you will be able to see how a person can log in and/or register and connect with the FIREBASE database, 
also if an error occurs, the system will automatically tell you what it is, 
to this you can add that it has a loading screen and Changes the functionality of the buttons when charging.

Once inside the App, we can see the title, a button to exit, a button to add a new product and the published products, 
if any. You can tap on any of the posted products to see them, like the database rules I used, it was all set to "true", 
anyone tapping on any product could edit or delete it, but that is changed by simply adding rules.

This app was developed during Udemy's Flutter course.
